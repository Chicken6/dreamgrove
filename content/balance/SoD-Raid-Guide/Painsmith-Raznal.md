## Notes For the Boss:
- **Currently there were no adds spawning in the intermission which means the fight was completely single target at least in heroic. (There were adds in beta)**
- You can use Door of Shadows/Soulshape in order to skip the Spiked Balls. This is very useful if you are chained.
- You can Wild Charge off the platform and back onto it in order to dodge the Spiked Balls. Disclaimer: I am not to blame if this backfires and you die because of this, it is very hard to pull off every time and should only be used if necessary.
- Front of the Pack is a really solid conduit choice for the intermission.

## Mythic only notes:
TBD

## Soulbinds:

## Talents:

- I am personally opposed to picking Stellar Drift as you can move without it with no problems.  
- Restoration Affinity is recommended as you can help out healing while moving in the intermission.
