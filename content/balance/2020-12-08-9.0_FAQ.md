# Balance Druid FAQ

## 9.0.5 Changes

**Necrolord:  {{< spell 325727 "Adaptive Swarm" >}} damage and healing increased by 25% and the effectiveness of periodic effects increased to 35% (was 30%):**

While Adaptive Swarm definitely needed a buff this will barely change anything and is not anywhere close to enough to make it a viable spell. The problem with the spell lies in it being sustained damage that needs setup which is inherently worse than burst like all other covenant abilities and on top of that doesn't scale with targets. The changes allow Necrolord druids to do whopping 2.5% more single target damage and 1% more AoE damage.

**Venthyr:  {{< spell 341383 "Endless Thirst" >}}(Covenant Conduit) now increases your critical strike chance by .8% per stack at Rank 1 (was .5%):**

Venthyr also required some buffs but these don't address the main problem Venthyr Druids have which is horrendous single target damage. They were 9%(!) behind on single target compared to Night Fae and are now still 7% behind. That being said starting from 3 targets Venthyr is now the best Covenant. The extreme loss in single target damage will still only be very rarely worth it and at least for raids Venthyr will continue being a troll pick.

## [1. Openers](#openers)

</div>

Kyrian - with and without {{< spell 339942 "Balance of All Things(BoAT)" >}} with {{< spell 202430 "Nature's Balance(NB)" >}}:<br/> Wrath, Wrath, Starfire, dots, Starfire, Starfire, Celestial Alignment/Incarnation(CA/Inc), {{< spell 326462 "Empower Bond" >}}, Starsurge 3x

Start casting from max range at ~3.5 sec.

<div id="legendaries">
 
## [2. What Legendaries should I craft?](#legendaries)

</div>

**Night Fae:**

In Raid: {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}}

In M+: {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} or {{< spell 338668 "Pulsar" >}} if you are pulling big commonly but currently not recommended due to the st loss.

**Kyrian/Venthyr:**

In Raid: {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}}

In M+: {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} for slightly more st and {{< spell 338657 "Circle" >}} or {{< spell 338668 "Pulsar" >}} for more AoE.


<div id="legendaries-slot">

## [3. What slot do I craft legendaries in?](#legendaries-slot)

</div>

**{{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} slot:**

In almost every scenario craft on boots (mastery and haste/vers).

The reason for this is that you can't get good stats on boots without being lucky in the weekly chest. Difference is extremely small either way.

**{{< spell 338668 "Pulsar" >}} slot:**

Gloves because of the fact that Denathrius shoulders have higher ilvl.

**{{< spell 338657 "Circle" >}} slot:**

Head because of the higher stat budget.

<div id="covenant">

## [4. What Covenant should I pick?](#covenant)

</div>

**Night Fae:**

By far the best Covenant for single target, easy to use and has extreme burst making it the best overall pick.

**Kyrian:**

Can perform well with a partner and is better in AoE than Night Fae but due to how the ability works it's rare to be able to get good value.

**Venthyr:**

Good for high M+ with big pulls but heavily outclassed on single target (roughly 7% worse than NF).

**Necrolord:**

Not currently competitive.

<div id="talents">
 
## [5. What Talents should I run?](#talents)

</div>

Default single target setup (pure single target raid bosses):
{{< talents spec="balance" src="live" recommend="322,113,223,333,131,113,311" >}}

Default AoE setup (M+ and heavy AoE bosses):
{{< talents spec="balance" src="live" recommend="322,113,223,333,311,311,311" >}}
Note that {{< spell 248280 "Force of Nature" >}} can and should be used in M+ for any key level where the tank could die even though they are a minor dps loss.

Mixed target count or mostly spread AoE (Inerva, Council):
{{< talents spec="balance" src="live" recommend="311,113,223,333,232,311,311" >}}
{{< spell 102560 "Incarnation" >}} should only be used for spread AoE like Council to pad on the waiters.

<div id="potions">

## [6. What potions should I use?](#potions)

</div>

{{< spell 307162 "Potion of Spectral Intellect" >}} for all situations.

<div id="kyrian">

## [7. How does Kindred Spirits (Kyrian covenant ability) work?](#kyrian)

</div>

When you use {{< spell 326434 "Kindred Spirits" >}} both people get an empty pool that lasts 20 seconds and 15% of your damage, healing and damage taken empties the pool to increase/absorb each. Each person also gets a buff that lasts 10 seconds and during that time 20% of your damage fills up the pool of the other person.

<div id="kyrian-bond">

## [8. Who do I bond Kindred Spirits with and when do I use it?](#kyrian-bond)

</div>

All specs with a 1min cd on abilities are good, for example Mages and MM hunter. Always make sure you use it when your partner uses his cd and when using {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} make sure a {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} window is within the Empower Bond buff.

<div id="convoke-delay">

## [9. Should I delay Convoke for it to line up with CA?](#convoke-delay)

</div>

Yes you should always delay {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} UNLESS you can cast a Convoke without losing a {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}+Convoke (both at the same time) cast. This will for example happen in 5 minute fights where you would cast Convoke+CA on pull, Convoke alone after 2 minutes and then Convoke+CA at 4 minutes.

For M+ the same logic applies when you for example know you won't be using your CA for another 2min due to saving it for a boss you can use a solo Convoke. This should be minized though as every desynced Convoke is a damage loss.

<div id="covenant-swap">
 
## [10. Should I pick another Covenant?](#covenant-swap)

</div>

If you are not happy with your current Covenant you can do that. The renown catchup is very forgiving, although if you are switching to Night Fae it should be noted that you only get the conduit {{< spell 341446 "Conflux of Elements" >}} on 145 ilvl.

<div id="iqd">
 
## [11. How does Inscrutable Quantum Device work?](#iqd)

</div>

When this trinket is used, it triggers one of the effects listed below.

- Remove CC from self: Always triggers if you are under a hard CC mechanic, does not trigger if the CC mechanic does not prevent the player from acting (e.g., it won't trigger while rooted).

- Heal spell: Triggers on self or a nearby target with less than 30% health remaining.

- Execute damage: Deals damage to the target if it is an enemy with less than 20% health remaining. (You can prevent this by untargetting the mob.)

- Triggers on a nearby healer with less than 20% mana.

- If a Bloodlust buff is up, the stat buff will last 25 seconds instead of the default 20 seconds.

- The secondary stat granted is randomly selected from stat from the player's two highest secondary stats in terms of rating. In Bloodlust however, the highest stat will always be chosen.

<div id="nerfs">

## [12. Is Balance/BoAT/Night Fae/Necrolord getting nerfed?](#nerfs)

</div>

We do not know, we are not working at Blizzard.

<div id="stats">
 
## [13. What is Balance Druids stat priority?](#stats)

</div>

Sim yourself using [Raidbots Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear). Do not follow any stat priorities.

<div id="aoe">
 
## [14. What is my AoE priority?](#aoe)

</div>

**AoE (with {{< spell 114107 "Soul of the Forest" >}}+{{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" >}}) starting at 2 targets:**

**Any situation:**

- Keep Starfall permanently up at any cost.

- Keep Sunfire permanently up. (Be sure to hit all of the mobs with one Sunfire cast)

**Outside any Eclipse:**

- Refresh Moonfire outside of Eclipse if and only if ALL of the following are true:
    - The next eclipse you will enter is Lunar Eclipse
    - All targets can be hit by Starfire
    - There are 5 or less targets
    - All targets will live through the entire Lunar Eclipse
    - You will not lose Starfall uptime

- Enter the next Eclipse if in no Eclipse, preferring Lunar Eclipse.

**Lunar Eclipse and both Eclipses (CA/Inc):**

- Use Starsurge to stop yourself from overcapping AsP until 6 targets at which point you should overcap.

- Refresh Moonfire if you are at 4 targets or below if the targets will live through the next Eclipse.

- Spam Starfire.

**Solar Eclipse:**

- Use Starsurge to stop yourself from overcapping AsP.

- Keep Moonfire up between 1 and 10 targets if they live through the next Eclipse and you won't lose Starfall uptime by doing so.

- Starfire when 5 targets can be hit by it, increased by 1 target for every 20% mastery you have.

- Wrath.

**Notes:**

- This should be used as a priority, going from top to bottom.

<div id="st">

## [15. What is my Single Target rotation?](#st)

</div>

**Pure Single Target with {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}}:**

- If you have CA and {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} off cooldown, then use them both together (refer to [#19](#swifty-macro)) when below 40 AP. For cooldown usage refer to [#9](#convoke-delay). Without Convoke use CA at 90+ AsP on cd.

- Transition into the next Eclipse if you are currently not in one, preferring Solar Eclipse when possible.

- Dump as many Starsurges as possible in the first globals of each Eclipse. The goal should be that the first 3 globals are always 3 Starsurges.

- Refresh Moonfire/Sunfire/Stellar Flare if:
    - The first 3 Starsurges are not being delayed.
    - You are currently inside an Eclipse.
    - The specific dot is below 30% of its base duration (pandemic window).

- Use Starsurge if you are going to overcap and will not lose one of your 3 Starsurges at the start of the next Eclipse. Up to 10 Astral Power can be overcapped in each Eclipse. If you overcapped more use Starsurge earlier in that situation.

- Use Wrath (inside Solar Eclipse) or Starfire (inside Lunar Eclipse) until you reach the next Eclipse

**Notes:**

- Maximizing Eclipse uptime allows you to maximize BoAT and Solstice uptime.

- With {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} use up all of your Astral Power in the previous Eclipse so that you enter the next Eclipse with less than 40 Astral Power and can cast {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}}.

- Having around 70 AsP at the end of an Eclipse is usually enough to be able to triple Starsurge at the start of the next Eclipse.

<div id="astral-damage">
 
## [16. What is Astral damage?](#astral-damage)

</div>

Astral damage is Arcane and Nature damage at the same time meaning that these spells benefit from effects that buff either spell school and double dip whenever effects that buff both are active. Mind that class buffs only affect class spells so if a trinket does nature or arcane damage they are not affected by our buffs to these spell classes.

<div id="double-on-use">

## [17. How to play NF double on use:](#double-on-use)

</div>

**Basic version:** 
- Use Empyreal Ordnance on pull and 20sec before pressing {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}.
- Hold {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} for {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}.

**Advanced version:** 

- Use the normal NF {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} opener.
- Press Empyreal Ordnance in between the first 2 Starsurges (on pull), then spam Starfire in Lunar Eclipse while pooling for the next Solar Eclipse. If you are inside a bloodlust window and around 400-500 haste you will most likely have to dump another Starsurge in this lunar Eclipse in order to not overcap.
- After exiting Lunar Eclipse (around 15sec into the fight) you want to go into Solar Eclipse, dump all your remaining AP and re use all 3 of your dots.
- Around 21sec into the fight, when you have the Empyreal Ordnance buff and can use your other trinket, press {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}, your 2nd on use trinket, your potion and {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}}.
- Continue your normal rotation.

**Notes:**

After the first CA Convoke you should be at 2 Starlord stacks. Because Convoke does not give you Starlord stacks, you want to use 1 Starsurge, then pool AsP up until your Starlord ends, then dump 3 Starsurges asap for the 3 Starlord stacks that should last until the end of your CA, then cancel Starlord at the start of your next Solar Eclipse if it does not line up.

<div id="owlkin-frenzy">

## [18. How do I use instant Starfire procs from Owlkin Frenzy?](#owlkin-frenzy)

</div>

When Lunar Eclipse is active use {{< spell 157228 "Owlkin Frenzy" >}} procs asap. When ONLY Solar Eclipse is active use it when fighting 3+ targets or when you need to move. Otherwise let it expire.

<div id="swifty-macro">

## [19. Useful CA + Convoke + Trinket macro:](#swifty-macro)

</div>


#showtooltip

/stopmacro [channeling: convoke the spirits]

/stopmacro [noform:4]

/cast Celestial Alignment

/cleartarget

/use 13

/targetlasttarget

/use Potion of Spectral Intellect

/cast Convoke the Spirits

/cqs

**Explanation:**

- DO NOT use this macro while on the gcd (like just having casted a dot or Starsurge) or the Convoke will not fire. Wait until the gcd is finished.

- "#showtooltip" makes the tooltip of {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}} show upon hovering over the macro
- "/stopmacro [channeling: convoke the spirits]" prevents the macro from being casted if you are currently channeling {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}}
- "/stopmacro [noform:4]" prevents the macro from being casted if you are NOT in Moonkin Form.
- "/cast Celestial Alignment" casts {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}
- "/cleartarget" clears your current target. This is useful whenever using the "Inscrutable Quantum Device" trinket and makes it so that the trinket does not use its execute part.
- "/use 13" uses the trinket in the 13/upper slot. You can use 14 if your on use trinket is in the bottom slot.
- "/targetlasttarget retargets your last target after being cleared by the "cleartarget". 
- "/use Potion of Spectral Intellect" uses your potion. If your potion is not assigned to any specific point you can put it here.
- "/cast Convoke the Spirits" uses the Nightfae covenant ability.
- "/cqs" cancels your Queued Spells. What this means is that your Convoke the Spirits will not get canceled if you press another button.

You can and should remove/add other commands to this macro depending on situation. For example the potion line, or the "stopmacro [noform:4]" line.

<div id="snapshot">

## [20. Do our dots snapshot?](#snapshot)

</div>

No, our dots (Moonfire, Sunfire, Stellar Flare) do NOT snapshot, everything is dynamic. That means any dots gain/lose the mastery bonus upon entering/leaving the Eclipse that buffs them.

<div id="filler">
 
## [21. What is my filler priority inside CA?](#filler)

</div>

1 Target:
- Starfire if at or above 110% haste (You would currently need both Bloodlust and Power Infusion or other external haste buffs in order to reach this amount. A WeakAura tracking your current haste value might come in handy.)
- Wrath if below 110% haste

2 Targets and above:
- Starfire

<div id="conduits">
 
## [22. What Soulbinds/Conduits should I pick as Night Fae?](#conduits)

</div>

**Soulbinds:**
- 99% of the time [Niya](https://www.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/night-fae/niya/druid) - Use {{< spell 320659 "Burrs" >}} for 1-3 targets or when there are immune targets it can proc on. Otherwise use a second potency conduit.
- 1% of the time [Korayn](https://www.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/night-fae/korayn/druid) - usable on Council of Blood if you are trying to pad on waiters. Disclaimer: Only usable in Mythic if waiters live long with Niklaus last. Also do not use it while progressing. 



**Conduits:**

**Potency:**
- {{< spell 341446 "Conflux of the Elements" >}}: 100% of the time this should be your first go to potency slot.
- {{< spell 340708 "Fury of the Skies" >}}: Default go to if the mobs live for a long duration or the pack density is low.
- {{< spell 340719 "Umbral Intensity" >}}: Default go to if the mobs live for a short duration or the pack density is high.
- {{< spell 340706 "Precise Alignment" >}}: Around the same value as Fury and Umbral, you can pick it if you don't know which of the other two to pick, might have some value if you want to extend your burst windows on AoE.
- {{< spell 340720 "Stellar Inspiration" >}}: Currently not ever worth using with only two Potency slots available.

Notes: Conflux is always used and the only choice to be made is between your 2nd potency slot which should be Fury or Umbral most of the time. This is mostly dungeon/personal preference as they have around the same throughput.

**Endurance:**
- {{< spell 340553 "Well-Honed Instincts" >}}: Default go to, one of the most overtuned endurance conduits in the game raid wise.
- {{< spell 340540 "Ursine Vigor" >}}: Really good if you will ever go into bear form to soak an ability. Especially good on progression and if you will ever press Heart of the Wild while being talented into Guardian Affinity. Examples: SLG Goliath wicked blade overlap / Sludgefist 2nd Chain Slam.
- {{< spell 340529 "Tough as Bark" >}}: Good if you press Barkskin a lot or the fight timers require a shorter CD on it.
- {{< spell 340543 "Innate Resolve" >}}: You can think of this as a buff to Well-Honed Instincts.
- {{< spell 340605 "Layered Mane" >}}: Unlike Well-hones Instincs this is a Guardian conduit that actually only Guardian wants.

Notes: Default Instincts and pick one of the other three usable conduits as your second choice.

**Finesse:**
- {{< spell 341280 "Born Anew" >}}: Good default pick, a main stat buff for a friend of yours. Can be used before a pull if a player can suicide and then be rezzed. It can also be traded in conjunction with Innervate for Power Infusion if a Discipline Priest in present in the raid.
- {{< spell 341450 "Front of the Pack" >}}: By default good whenever you want to use your Stampeding Roar and is especially good on Artificer (Covers out the whole duration of Annihilation) and on Sire Denathrius (Really good in P1 intermission, P3 1st and 2nd Massacre because of the Ravage overlaps)
- {{< spell 341451 "Born of the Wilds" >}}: Good in M+ if you have to offheal a lot.
- {{< spell 340545 "Tireless Pursuit" >}}: Might help a bit if you find yourself using cat form a lot to fill movement gaps.

Notes: Default into any of them, they are mostly personal preference.
