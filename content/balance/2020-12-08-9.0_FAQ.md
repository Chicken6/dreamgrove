Notes:

## 2. What Legendaries should i craft?

**It is recommended that if you are competitive with raiding/m+/pvp you should not craft a legendary before mythic week.**

Night fae:
In Raid: BOAT
In M+: BOAT or Pulsar if you are pulling really big

Kyrian/Venthyr:
In Raid: Boat or Pulsar
In M+: Pulsar >= Boat


## 3.What slot do I craft legendaries in?

BOAT slot: in almost every scenario craft on boots (mastery and vers/haste - vers more stable) 

Note: you craft on boots because you can't get good stats on boots from neither raid nor m+

Pulsar slot: Gloves because of the fact that Denathrius shoulders have higher ilvl


## 4. What Covenant should i pick?

Here are the ups and downs of every covenant. Choose one yourself, it will differ for each person.

Kyrian: 
+ Scales into aoe

- Relies on teammates
- Has high skill cap

Night Fae:
+ Very good on ST

- Does not scale well into aoe
- Rng targeting

Venthyr:

+ Good for high M+ with big pulls

Necrolord:

- Not currently competitive


## 5. What Talents should I run?

TBD


## 6. What potions should I use?

Potion of Spectral Intellect for all cases, because it has very good aoe scaling and is very close to Phantom Fire which sims 10dps more on ST but is not worth because of the high variables.


## 7. How does kindred spirits (kyrian bond) work?

When you use it both people get an empty pool that lasts 20 seconds and 15% of your damage, healing and damage taken empties the pool to increase/lessen each. Each person also gets a buff that lasts 10 seconds and during that time 20% of your damage fills up the pool of the other person.


## 8. Who do i bond Kindred spirits with?

All specs with a 1min cd on abilities are good, for example MM hunter


## 9. Should I delay convoke for it to line up with CA?

If you do not lose a convoke cast yes, if not press it on cd.


## 10. Should I pick another covenant?

If you are not happy with your covenant you can do that but you should not do it before mythic week in case of any nerfs.


## 11. How does Inscrutable Quantum Device work?

When this trinket is used, it triggers one of the effects listed above.
- remove CC from self: Always triggers if you are under a hard CC mechanic, does not trigger if the CC mechanic does not prevent the player from acting (e.g., it won't trigger while rooted).
- heal spell: Triggers on self or a nearby target with less than 30% health remaining.
- execute damage: Deal damage to the target if it is an enemy with less than 20% health remaining 
- triggers on a nearby healer with less than 20% mana
- If a Bloodlust buff is up, the stat buff will last 25 seconds instead of the default 20 seconds.
- The secondary stat granted appears to be randomly selected from stat from the player's two highest secondary stats in terms of rating.


## 12. Is Balance/BOAT/Night Fae getting nerfed?

We do not know, we are not working at Blizzard.


## 13. What is Balance Druids stat priority?

Sim yourself on raidbots.com, stat weights differ a lot.
Note: 
In general BOAT devalues Crit and values Mastery.
Haste has very weird breakpoints especially with BOAT


## 14. What is my aoe priority?

AOE (with sotf+sd):
- starfall perma up 
- sunfire perma up pref if u can hit all in 1 hit

Lunar:
- do not moonfire, just spam starfire

Solar:
- keep moonfire up to infinite targets if they live for more than 10-15sec
- starfire on 5+ tar increased by 1 every 500mast (if u can hit all of them)
- wrath if starfire isn't worth casting

Notes: 
- prioritize lunar eclipse over solar
- do not press starsurge in lunar eclipse if over 8 targets can get hit by starfire (yes overcap ap)
