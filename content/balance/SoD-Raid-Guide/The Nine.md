## Notes For the Boss:
- Barkskin every time you go out and Healthstone / Healing Pot if you need them, they are not needed at any specific part in the fight. Good to have if soaking.
- If you are soaking outside of the range of the boss opt into using HotW with Guardian Affinity and one Frenzied Regeneration in order to mitigate the passive damage taken from not being in Healing Rain/Efflo and the soaks themselves. Try to keep Barkskin for the puddle debuffs, as you can most of the time place them while DPSing the boss and not lose any uptime.
- Use Wild Charge if you are close to the spot you have to move to, otherwise if talented into SD you can cast a starfall to more both out and back inside the group if you get targeted by mechanics. If you are ot playing Stellar drift and the Wild Charge range is not enough you can opt into using a Door of Shadows. Stay inside the group otherwise.

## Mythic only notes:
TBD

## Soulbinds:
[Venthyr](https://ptr.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/venthyr/theotar-the-mad-duke/druid/AwCW75YCFTUgACU1ygASBTWHACUy4gAiBTJJABUyPwA)
<br>[Night Fae](https://ptr.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/night-fae/niya/druid)

## Talents:
Stellar Drift looks like the go to for now, but if adds and p1 are not a problem you can and should opt into Stellar Flare for the p2 boss damage, especially if playing Venthyr.
