## 9.1 TENTATIVE Changes

**{{< spell 274281 "Moons" >}} recharge time reduced from 25 seconds to 20 seconds and 33% dmg buff to NEW and HALF moon:**

Weak buff that makes it good enough for single target but they still scale badly in AoE. This does NOT buff full moon.

**{{< spell 343647 "Solstice" >}} increased Shooting Stars chance reduced from 300% to 250%:**

Major nerf that makes this talent only usable on spread AoE.

The {{< spell 274281 "Moons" >}} buffs and {{< spell 343647 "Solstice" >}} nerfs will mean that each talent in the row will be used in a different scenario: 
{{< spell 343647 "Solstice" >}} = Spread AoE; Fury of Elune = Stacked AoE; {{< spell 274281 "Moons" >}} = Single Target

**{{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" >}} reworked to no longer increase duration but damage by 50% instead of 15% and adds a 12 second CD to Starfall:**

For sustained AoE this is no longer a loss but not a gain either. Since there appear to be a number of burst AoE fights in the raid this talent will see use in its current state but for sustained AoE (like higher M+) it will be unlikely taken unless the movement component is of very high value. Independent of how good this talent ends up being giving Starfall a CD leads to very awkward gameplay as we now have even more periods where we are stuck spending Starsurge in AoE when taking this talent.

**{{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} crit chance per stack reduced to 3% but now starts at 8 stacks (24%) reduced over 8 seconds instead of 5:**

Major nerf that was expected to happen but BoAT will still be our go to legi for single target for anything that isn't Venthyr.

**{{< item 180117 "Empyreal Ordnance" >}} now incurs a 40 second trinket cooldown:**

This kills double on use.

All these changes add up to ~5% nerf on single target without double on-use and ~7% with double on-use. The AoE nerf is roughly 4% due to the BoAT and Drift change. Due to loss of movement the loss will be slightly higher in many cases. There will be more changes coming to PTR.

**Covenant specific legendaries:**

**Kyrian:  
{{< spell 354115 "Kindred Affinity" >}}: Give your partner a permanent 5% mastery (modified by their mastery modifier) and you get a permanent 5% stat based on their covenant. This bonus is increased to 10% while the bond is active:**

Kyrian: Mastery,
Night Fae: Haste,
Venthyr: Crit,
Necrolord: Versatility

Extremely strong effect when paired with someone who benefits a lot from mastery or stats in general (who may that be). Has the potential to make Kyrian viable in a simp meta but does not fix the glaring problems Kyrian has as a whole.

**Night Fae:**  
**{{< spell 354118 "Celestial Spirits" >}}: Halves the cooldown and spells cast by Convoke (to 1min CD and 8 spells cast) and increases the chance of a Full Moon:**

This legendary has received NO tuning so this will not be the final iteration. As it stands it gives 16 Niya mastery stacks and uses a deck of cards system which makes Convoke always cast 1 Full Moon in 2 Convoke casts. It also slightly more than halves the Starsurges and Wrath casts. Due to the mastery stacks it's a very strong contender but again this may not be intentional so before doing anything more detailed we will be waiting until it receives some tuning.

**Necrolord:  
~~Wrathful~~ ~~Locust~~{{< spell 354123 "Unbridled Swarm" >}}: Adaptive Swarm has a 60% chance to split into 2 Swarms when it expires on a target:**

Useless on single target but possibly good for 2-4 targets as it allows for much higher uptime. Increases the offensive swarms you get per cast from 2 to 3.56 which equates to a 78% increase. Still does not make Necrolord competitive (for now).

**Venthyr:  
{{< spell 354109 "Sinful Hysteria" >}}: Every time you cast a spell during Ravenous Frenzy its duration is increased by 0.2 seconds. Additional extends the buff another 5s after it expires without being able to stack further:**

Has a lot of potential and roughly adds 8+5 seconds during Bloodlust or 6+5 seconds without Bloodlust. Would require you to play with {{< spell 340706 "Precise Alignment" >}} and Inc but allows for extremely high burst every 3min over the ~30 seconds, ~~probably~~ beating anything else in the game for "bursts" of that duration. The tuning of this legi will single-handedly decide whether Venthyr will be good or not as it's roughly a 15% dps gain which is about twice as good as all other available legis for us.

Again all these changes are TENTATIVE and there will be more to come.

# [2. Rotation:](#rotation)

</div>

<div id="openers">

## [Openers](#openers)

</div>

Kyrian - with and without {{< spell 339942 "Balance of All Things(BoAT)" >}} with {{< spell 202430 "Nature's Balance(NB)" >}}:<br/> {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}}, Wrath, {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}}, dots, Starfire, Starfire, {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}, {{< spell 326462 "Empower Bond" >}}, {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} 3x

Night Fae - no BoAT (with NB):<br/> {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}}, Wrath, {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}}, dots, {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}, {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} 2x, {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}}, Starsurge until you have no more AsP

Night Fae - with BoAT (with NB):<br/> {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}}, Wrath, {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}}, Starsurge, dots, {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}, Convoke, Starsurge until you have no more AsP

 
Notes:

In raid with {{< spell 202430 "Nature's Balance" >}} first 12 Astral Power gets reset to 50.

Start casting from max range at ~3.5-4.5 sec.


<div id="aoe">
 
## [What is my AoE priority?](#aoe)

</div>

**AoE (with {{< spell 114107 "Soul of the Forest" >}}+{{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" >}}) starting at 2 targets:**

**Any situation:**

- Keep {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} permanently up above anything else.

- Keep {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}} permanently up. If the mobs aren't stacked yet wait with this until they are.

**Outside any Eclipse:**

- Refresh {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} outside of Eclipse if and only if ALL of the following are true:
    - The next eclipse you will enter is Lunar Eclipse
    - All targets can be hit by {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}}
    - There are 5 or less targets
    - All targets will live through the entire Lunar Eclipse
    - You will not lose Starfall uptime

- Enter the next Eclipse if in no Eclipse, preferring Lunar Eclipse.

**Lunar Eclipse and both Eclipses (CA/Inc):**

- Use {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} to stop yourself from overcapping AsP until 6 targets at which point you should overcap.

- Refresh Moonfire if you are at 4 targets or below if the targets will live through the next Eclipse.

- Spam Starfire.

**Solar Eclipse:**

- Use Starsurge to stop yourself from overcapping AsP.

- Keep Moonfire up between 1 and 10 targets if they live through the next Eclipse and you won't lose Starfall uptime by doing so.

- Starfire when 5 targets can be hit by it, increased by 1 target for every 20% mastery you have.

- Spam {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}}.

**Notes:**

- This should be used as a priority, going from top to bottom.


<div id="st">

## [What is my Single Target rotation?](#st)

</div>

**Pure Single Target with {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}}:**

- If you have {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}} and {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} off cooldown, then use them both together (refer to [#19](#swifty-macro)) when below 40 AP. For cooldown usage refer to [#9](#convoke-delay). Without Convoke use CA at 90+ AsP on cd.

- Transition into the next Eclipse if you are currently not in one, preferring Solar Eclipse when possible.

- Dump as many {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} as possible in the first globals of each Eclipse. The goal should be that the first 3 globals are always 3 Starsurges.

- Refresh {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} / {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}} / {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare " >}} if:
    - The first 3 Starsurges are not being delayed.
    - You are currently inside an Eclipse.
    - The specific dot is below 30% of its base duration (pandemic window).

- Use Starsurge if you are going to overcap and will not lose one of your 3 Starsurges at the start of the next Eclipse. Up to 10 Astral Power can be overcapped in each Eclipse. If you overcapped more use Starsurge earlier in that situation.

- Use {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}} (inside Solar Eclipse) or {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} (inside Lunar Eclipse) until you reach the next Eclipse.

**Notes:**

- Maximizing Eclipse uptime allows you to maximize BoAT and {{< spell 343647 "Solstice" >}} uptime.

- With {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} use up all of your Astral Power in the previous Eclipse so that you enter the next Eclipse with less than 40 Astral Power and can cast {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}}.

- Having around 70 AsP at the end of an Eclipse is usually enough to be able to triple Starsurge at the start of the next Eclipse.


<div id="filler">
 
## [What is my filler priority inside CA?](#filler)

</div>

1 Target:
- Starfire if at or above 110% haste (You would currently need both Bloodlust and Power Infusion or other external haste buffs in order to reach this amount. A WeakAura tracking your current haste value might come in handy.)
- {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}} if below 110% haste

2 Targets and above:
- {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}}


<div id="owlkin-frenzy">

## [How do I use instant Starfire procs from Owlkin Frenzy?](#owlkin-frenzy)

</div>

When Lunar Eclipse is active use {{< spell 157228 "Owlkin Frenzy" >}} procs asap. When ONLY Solar Eclipse is active use it when fighting 3+ targets or when you need to move. Otherwise let it expire.


<div id="snapshot">

## [Do our dots snapshot?](#snapshot)

</div>

No, our dots ({{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}}, {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}}, {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare " >}}) do NOT snapshot, everything is dynamic. That means any dots gain/lose the mastery bonus upon entering/leaving the Eclipse that buffs them.


<div id="double-on-use">

## [How to play NF double on-use:](#double-on-use)

</div>

**With the future 9.1 Empyreal Ordnance changes, combining EO with another on use trinket will not be viable!**

**Basic version:** 
- Use Empyreal Ordnance on pull and 20sec before pressing {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}.
- Hold {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} for {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}.

**Advanced version:** 

- Use the normal NF {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} opener.
- Press Empyreal Ordnance in between the first 2 Starsurges (on pull), then spam Starfire in Lunar Eclipse while pooling for the next Solar Eclipse. If you are inside a bloodlust window and around 400-500 haste you will most likely have to dump another Starsurge in this lunar Eclipse in order to not overcap.
- After exiting Lunar Eclipse (around 15sec into the fight) you want to go into Solar Eclipse, dump all your remaining AP and re use all 3 of your dots.
- Around 21sec into the fight, when you have the Empyreal Ordnance buff and can use your other trinket, press {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}, your 2nd on-use trinket, your potion and {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}}.
- Continue your normal rotation.

**Notes:**

After the first CA Convoke you should be at 2 Starlord stacks. Because Convoke does not give you Starlord stacks, you want to use 1 Starsurge, then pool AsP up until your Starlord ends, then dump 3 Starsurges asap for the 3 Starlord stacks that should last until the end of your CA, then cancel Starlord at the start of your next Solar Eclipse if it does not line up.



<div id="setup">

<div id="stats">
 
## [What is Balance Druids stat priority?](#stats)

</div>

Sim yourself using [Raidbots Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear). Do not follow any stat priorities.


<div id="trinkets">

## [What Trinkets should I use?](#trinkets)

</div>

**With the future 9.1 Empyreal Ordnance changes, combining EO with another on use trinket will not be viable!**

**DISCLAIMER: All of the trinkets in the following are examples. Your personal best trinkets depend on more factors such as ilvl meaning the best option is always to sim using either Top Gear, Droptimizer or Gear Compare.**

**There are 3 setups for trinket combinations:**
1. Double on-use
2. One on-use + one equip
3. Double equip


**Double on-use:**
This combination can prove to be the strongest by far and excels in single target. The only problem is that it requires specific trinkets and can be heavily devalued by fight timers and volatility. This means it should not be used in unpredictable scenarios or situations where you have to either use your cooldowns immediately or you would lose a {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} by playing double on-use.
Refer to [#17](#double-on-use) to learn more about how to play with this combination.

Usable Trinkets:
- Slot 1 (EO): {{< item 180117 "Empyreal Ordnance" >}} is the only trinket slotable as it is the only reason this build exists.
- Slot 2 (another on-use): {{< item 179350 "Inscrutable Quantum Device" >}}, {{< item 184842 "Instructor's Divine Bell" >}} and others.

Note: {{< item 178809 "Soulletting Ruby" >}} should not be used with this setup due to the travel time making it incredibly hard to use.

**2. One on-use, one equip:**
This combination should be used whenever double on-use is not a viable choice. A good example would be in M+ where without a lot of practice and coordination the pulling and damage pattern can be very volatile and you might have to use your cooldowns instantly.

Usable trinkets:
- Slot 1 (Equip): {{< item 184028 "Cabalist's Hymnal" >}}, {{< item 178708 "Unbound Changeling" >}}, {{< item 178386 "Insignia of Alacrity" >}} and others.
- Slot 2 (On-use): {{< item 179350 "Inscrutable Quantum Device" >}}, {{< item 184842 "Instructor's Divine Bell" >}}, {{< item 178809 "Soulletting Ruby" >}} and others. 


**3. Double Equip:**
This combination is basically a budget version of the previous one, as in most scenarios the one of on-use trinket is going to outshine the 2nd on-use trinket due to the bursty damage pattern inside our {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}} paired with {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}}

Usable trinkets:
- Slot 1+2 (Equip): {{< item 184028 "Cabalist's Hymnal" >}}, {{< item 178708 "Unbound Changeling" >}}, {{< item 178386 "Insignia of Alacrity" >}} and others.

**Notable trinkets:**
{{< item 179350 "Inscrutable Quantum Device" >}}: This trinket has the potential to be the best on-use trinket by a large margin if the conditions found in [#11](#iqd) are met. These ultimately mean that the trinket is extremely good in M+ and whenever you can gurantee that later trinket usages are either in Bloodlust or when healers still have enough mana. You can adjust the value in sims using the IQD Stat Proc Chance option which will set the chance the trinket gives stats outside Bloodlust.

{{< item 184842 "Instructor's Divine Bell" >}}: Unlike the Quantum Device, the bell is a very consistent trinket that gives us a lot of mastery inside our burst windows. The only downside of this trinket is its aquisiton, a very low drop chance from bastion callings, mission table rewards or a worldquest.

{{< item 180117 "Empyreal Ordnance" >}}: The enabler of the double on-use combination is one of the more special trinkets and works in two parts: a dot and a buff. After the dot finishes, the buff part of the trinket comes back to the caster. Due to this it should mostly only be used in combination with another on-use trinket and not as a standalone when possible.

{{< item 184028 "Cabalist's Hymnal" >}}: A very overstatted trinket that outshines all other equip trinkets due to both the ammount of stats it gives and the high ilvl it is obtainable at.

{{< item 178708 "Unbound Changeling" >}}: This trinket gains most of its value from the fact that it is convertable into a stat proc of your choice by eating the corresponding food. Once a day it has a chance to proc 3 secondary stats which further increases its value. Mastery proc can be used a default but sim to find which secondary it should proc.

{{< item 178386 "Insignia of Alacrity" >}}: Another equip trinket which has both positives and negatives. The negatives being that the trinket has a low stat budget and the positives being that it can be easily acquired through PvP at 226 ilvl if you can reach 2.1k rating.

{{< item 178809 "Soulletting Ruby" >}}: Although this trinket gives crit it gives a very high amount of it making it a very good option if you don't have access to another on-use trinket. When using it mind that it has a short delay before getting the buff depending on distance to the target.


<div id="talents">
 
## [What Talents should I run?](#talents)

</div>

Default single target setup (pure single target raid bosses):
{{< talents spec="balance" src="live" recommend="322,113,223,333,131,113,311" >}}

Default AoE setup (M+ and heavy AoE bosses):
{{< talents spec="balance" src="live" recommend="322,113,223,333,311,311,311" >}}
Note that {{< spell 248280 "Force of Nature" >}} can and should be used in M+ for any key level where the tank could die even though they are a minor dps loss.

Mixed target count or mostly spread AoE (Inerva, Council):
{{< talents spec="balance" src="live" recommend="311,113,223,333,232,311,311" >}}
{{< spell 102560 "Incarnation" >}} should only be used for spread AoE like Council to pad on the waiters.


<div id="t50">
 
## [T50 row choices and playstyle (9.1)](#t50)

<div>
 

**In 9.1 we will probably have at least two playable builds which depend mainly on covenant:**

   - NF Boat 
   - Venthyr Hysteria

**Venthyr Hysteria:**

- {{< spell 343647 "Solstice" >}} is playable in spread aoe but requires 3+ targets of permanent uptime which can be very very hard to find. The closest example where Solstice would beat FoE on paper would be Council of Blood from Castle Nathria.

- {{< spell 202770 "FoE" >}} is incredibly strong with this build beating out any other talent in 99% of the situations on both ST and stacked AoE. You will want to use FoE whenever you have 9 sec left on Ravenous Frenzy inside Incarnation, and on cd inside any eclipse whenever outside of it.

- {{< spell 274281 "Moons" >}} should never get picked with this build as they are inferior to FoE in every scenario.

**Night Fae Boat:**

- {{< spell 343647 "Solstice" >}} is a better choice for this build when compared to Venthyr because of the fact that FoE is not as strong, meaning that you will have more oportunities to pick this talent depending on the raid fight.

- {{< spell 202770 "FoE" >}} is again very strong, but this time only on stacked AOE rather than ST and should be used 1 global before CA+Convoke or on cd as the first global of a new eclipse if CA+Convoke are not available. On burst ST that is above 8sec FoE is better than Moons.

- {{< spell 274281 "Moons" >}} should be picked over FoE as they are the roughly a 0.7% dps upgrade over FoE on pure ST. Save moons for ca/inc, without overcapping and if not inside CA/Inc they should preferably be casted inside Lunar Eclipse. Half Moon should be casted inside BoAT window if possible.


<div id="conduits">
 
## [What Conduits should I pick?](#conduits)

</div>

**Potency:**
- {{< spell 341446 "Conflux of the Elements" >}}: 100% of the time this should be your first go to potency slot.
- {{< spell 340708 "Fury of the Skies" >}}: Default go to if the mobs live for a long duration or the pack density is low.
- {{< spell 340719 "Umbral Intensity" >}}: Default go to if the mobs live for a short duration or the pack density is high.
- {{< spell 340706 "Precise Alignment" >}}: Around the same value as Fury and Umbral, you can pick it if you don't know which of the other two to pick, might have some value if you want to extend your burst windows on AoE.
- {{< spell 340720 "Stellar Inspiration" >}}: Currently not ever worth using with only two Potency slots available.

Notes: Conflux is always used and the only choice to be made is between your 2nd potency slot which should be Fury or Umbral most of the time. This is mostly dungeon/personal preference as they have around the same throughput.

**Endurance:**
- {{< spell 340553 "Well-Honed Instincts" >}}: Default go to, one of the most overtuned endurance conduits in the game raid wise.
- {{< spell 340540 "Ursine Vigor" >}}: Really good if you will ever go into bear form to soak an ability. Especially good on progression and if you will ever press Heart of the Wild while being talented into Guardian Affinity. Examples: SLG Goliath wicked blade overlap / Sludgefist 2nd Chain Slam.
- {{< spell 340529 "Tough as Bark" >}}: Good if you press Barkskin a lot or the fight timers require a shorter CD on it.
- {{< spell 340543 "Innate Resolve" >}}: You can think of this as a buff to Well-Honed Instincts.
- {{< spell 340605 "Layered Mane" >}}: Unlike Well-hones Instincs this is a Guardian conduit that actually only Guardian wants.

Notes: Default Instincts and pick one of the other three usable conduits as your second choice.

**Finesse:**
- {{< spell 341280 "Born Anew" >}}: Good default pick, a main stat buff for a friend of yours. Can be used before a pull if a player can suicide and then be rezzed. It can also be traded in conjunction with Innervate for Power Infusion if a Discipline Priest in present in the raid.
- {{< spell 341450 "Front of the Pack" >}}: By default good whenever you want to use your Stampeding Roar and is especially good on Artificer (Covers out the whole duration of Annihilation) and on Sire Denathrius (Really good in P1 intermission, P3 1st and 2nd Massacre because of the Ravage overlaps)
- {{< spell 341451 "Born of the Wilds" >}}: Good in M+ if you have to offheal a lot.
- {{< spell 340545 "Tireless Pursuit" >}}: Might help a bit if you find yourself using cat form a lot to fill movement gaps.

Notes: Default into any of them, they are mostly personal preference.


<div id="soulbinds">
 
## [What Soulbinds should I pick as Night Fae?](#soulbinds)

</div>

**Soulbinds:**
- 99% of the time [Niya](https://www.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/night-fae/niya/druid) - Use {{< spell 320659 "Burrs" >}} for 1-3 targets or when there are immune targets it can proc on. Otherwise use a second potency conduit.
- 1% of the time [Korayn](https://www.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/night-fae/korayn/druid) - usable on Council of Blood if you are trying to pad on waiters. Disclaimer: Only usable in Mythic if waiters live long with Niklaus last. Also do not use it while progressing. 


<div id="potions">

## [What potions should I use?](#potions)

</div>

{{< spell 307162 "Potion of Spectral Intellect" >}} for all situations.



<div id="meaningfulchoice">

# [4.Meaningful Choices:](#meaningfulchoice)

</div>


<div id="legendaries">

## [What Legendaries should I craft?](#legendaries)

</div>

**Night Fae:**

In Raid: {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}}

In M+: {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} or {{< spell 338668 "Pulsar" >}} if you are pulling big commonly but currently not recommended due to the st loss.

**Kyrian/Venthyr:**

In Raid: {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}}

In M+: {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} for slightly more st and {{< spell 338657 "Circle" >}} or {{< spell 338668 "Pulsar" >}} for more AoE.

**New covenant legendaries are work in progress!**


<div id="legendaries-slot">

## [What slot do I craft legendaries in?](#legendaries-slot)

</div>

**{{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} slot:**

In almost every scenario craft on boots (mastery and haste/vers).

The reason for this is that you can't get good stats on boots without being lucky in the weekly chest. Difference is extremely small either way.

**{{< spell 338668 "Pulsar" >}} slot:**

Gloves because of the fact that Stone Legion Generals shoulders have higher ilvl.

**{{< spell 338657 "Circle" >}} slot:**

Head because of the higher stat budget.


<div id="covenant">

## [What Covenant should I pick?](#covenant)

</div>

**Night Fae:**

By far the best Covenant for single target, easy to use and has extreme burst making it the best overall pick.

**Kyrian:**

Can perform well with a partner and is better in AoE than Night Fae but due to how the ability works it's rare to be able to get good value.

**Venthyr:**

Good for high M+ with big pulls but heavily outclassed on single target (roughly 7% worse than NF). Might become the best choice on ST aswell depending on the power of the new legendary. (TBD)

**Necrolord:**

Not currently competitive.

**Should I delay Convoke for it to line up with CA?**


Yes you should always delay {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} UNLESS you can cast a Convoke without losing a {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}+Convoke (both at the same time) cast. This will for example happen in 5 minute fights where you would cast Convoke+CA on pull, Convoke alone after 2 minutes and then Convoke+CA at 4 minutes.

For M+ the same logic applies when you for example know you won't be using your CA for another 2min due to saving it for a boss you can use a solo Convoke. This should be minimized though as every desynced Convoke is a damage loss.

**How are ultimate spells (moons) calculated in convoke?**

Currently from what we know, the chance of getting a Full Moon during Convoke the Spirits is based on a "Stacked Deck" system. Essentially, what this means is that every time you cast convoke, you have a chance of getting a full moon within that Convoke. Implying that Convoke has a 1 in 5 chance of proccing a full moon, that means that we shuffle 5 cards in our deck. Every time we use Convoke, we draw one card, meaning that the second convoke usage will be a 1 in 4 and so on. After the whole deck has been drawn, the cards get reshuffled into the deck.
What this means is that on an encounter that is for example 15 minutes long and we use convoke exactly 5 times, we will proc a single moon, not more and not less.


This mechanic resets when you leave combat, so for the purposes of M+, if you cast a convoke on a pack and you do not get a full moon, and then you leave combat, you are reshuffling your 5 card deck, essentialling resetting your chances of getting a full moon.

- How does Kindred Spirits (Kyrian covenant ability) work?

When you use {{< spell 326434 "Kindred Spirits" >}} both people get an empty pool that lasts 20 seconds and 15% of your damage, healing and damage taken empties the pool to increase/absorb each. Each person also gets a buff that lasts 10 seconds and during that time 20% of your damage fills up the pool of the other person.



- Who do I bond Kindred Spirits with and when do I use it?


All specs with a 1min cd on abilities are good, for example Mages and MM hunter. Always make sure you use it when your partner uses his cd and when using {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} make sure a {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} window is within the Empower Bond buff.

## [Useful CA + Convoke + Trinket macro:](#swifty-macro)

</div>


```
#showtooltip
/stopmacro [channeling: convoke the spirits]
/stopmacro [noform:4]
/cast Celestial Alignment
/cleartarget
/use 13
/targetlasttarget
/use Potion of Spectral Intellect
/cast Convoke the Spirits
/cqs
```

**Explanation:**

- DO NOT use this macro while on the gcd (like just having casted a dot or Starsurge) or the {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} will not fire. Wait until the gcd is finished.

- "#showtooltip" makes the tooltip of {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}} show upon hovering over the macro.
- "/stopmacro [channeling: convoke the spirits]" prevents the macro from being casted if you are currently channeling {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}}.
- "/stopmacro [noform:4]" prevents the macro from being casted if you are NOT in Moonkin Form.
- "/cast Celestial Alignment" casts {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}.
- "/cleartarget" clears your current target. This is useful whenever using the "Inscrutable Quantum Device" trinket and makes it so that the trinket does not use its execute part. Do not use this with a targeted trinket.
- "/use 13" uses the trinket in the 13/upper slot. You can use 14 if your on-use trinket is in the bottom slot.
- "/targetlasttarget retargets your last target after being cleared by the "cleartarget". 
- "/use Potion of Spectral Intellect" uses your potion. If your potion is not assigned to any specific point you can put it here.
- "/cast Convoke the Spirits" uses the Nightfae covenant ability.
- "/cqs" cancels your queued spell. Convoke can sometimes cancel itself when using a macro due to weirdness with spell queuing. This stops any weirdness thus your Convoke from ever cancelling itself.

You can and should remove/add other commands to this macro depending on situation. For example the potion line, or the "stopmacro [noform:4]" line.

## [How does Inscrutable Quantum Device work?](#iqd)

</div>

When this trinket is used, it triggers the effect with the first condition that applies from the following list:

- Remove CC from self: Always triggers if you are under a hard CC mechanic, does not trigger if the CC mechanic does not prevent the player from acting (e.g., it won't trigger while rooted).

- Heal spell: Triggers on self or a nearby target with less than 30% health remaining.

- Execute damage: Deals damage to the target if it is an enemy with less than 20% health remaining. (You can prevent this by untargetting the mob via a macro, see [#19](#swifty-macro).)

- If a Bloodlust buff is up, the stat buff will last 25 seconds instead of the default 20 seconds, always be your highest rating and have higher prio than giving mana.

- Triggers on a nearby healer with less than 30% mana.

- The secondary stat granted is randomly selected from the player's two highest secondary stats in terms of rating.


<div id="astral-damage">
 
## [What is Astral damage?](#astral-damage)

</div>

Astral damage is Arcane and Nature damage at the same time meaning that these spells benefit from effects that buff either spell school and double dip whenever effects that buff both are active. Mind that class buffs only affect class spells so if a trinket does nature or arcane damage they are not affected by our buffs to these spell classes.
