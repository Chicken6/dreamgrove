## Notes For the Boss:
- Stellar Drift has a lot of value in this fight as it is relatively movement heavy with a bunch of adds spawning throughout the fight. Use this whenever you help with chain grips.
- Wild Charge the puddles. If you get hit by one, you can pop a starfall and soak the ghosts.
- Door of Shadows is usable whenever you have to dodge the beam and move to the other platform.

## Mythic only notes:
TBD

## Soulbinds:

[Night Fae](https://ptr.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/night-fae/niya/druid)

## Talents:

You can run either Moons or Foe as Night Fae, but i would recommend Moons as Foe can bug on the chains sometimes and its not really worth the effort trying to line up some wonky 2 target cleave for a bit more damage.
