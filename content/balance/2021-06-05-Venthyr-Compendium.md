**The legendary Venthyr depends on is currently bugged to not work with the Endless Thirst conduit, meaning the extra 5 seconds are not gaining the crit chance.** It is assumed that bug is fixed for the purpose of this guide. You will not match the expected dps on ptr though.

This guide is not telling you to pick Venthyr or that Venthyr is always the superior pick. It is simply made to show everything about how to maximize your potential as a Venthyr Balance Druid if you do decide to switch to Venthyr.
As we are still in the PTR-cycle it is very possible that the next PTR patch will either make Venthyr far worse or make another Covenant far better.

All information in this guide was tested and verfied using simulations and the (current) APL can be found here as long as Venthyr is only relevant for PTR: https://github.com/balance-simc/Balance-SimC/blob/master/balance_ptr.txt.

Everything in this guides assumes you are playing with the new Venthyr legendary Sinful Hysteria as this is the reason that Venthyr has gotten any attention at all.

Going from Night Fae Balance Druid to Venthyr Druid is a big gameplay change on single target and will take some getting used to so don't expect your first runs to be succesful.

# [Single Target:](#single-target)

</div>

Due to no longer using Balance of All Things there is no longer as compelling of a reason to Starsurge at the beginning of an Eclipse and thus you can often save Astral Power for movement without any relevant dps loss. Starsurge Empowerment exists but it is a very weak effect.

On single target about 65% of your damage will be during CA/Inc+Ravenous Frenzy meaning it is extremely important to be able to cast during that time and that the target will live for the entire duration of your cooldowns. Since the legendary only does anything during our cooldowns you will do about 20% less damage outside cooldowns than you did with NF-BoAT Balance Druid.

**Single target priority list OUTSIDE cooldowns:** 
- Keep up Moonfire, Sunfire and Stellar Flare and refresh within pandemic
- Enter the next Eclipse, preferring Solar Eclipse
- Cast Fury of Elune if it will be up again for your next usage in CA/Inc
- Cast Starsurge when you would overcap Astral Power before entering the next Eclipse. This usually equates to spending 3 Starsurges at the start like you did with BoAT but can vary. Don't spend if you need to move soon.
- Cast Wrath in Solar Eclipse
- Cast Starfire in Lunar Eclipse
- Cast dots if have nothing to cast while you are moving

**Single target priority list BEFORE cooldowns:**
- Make sure to have 90+ Astral Power before using cooldowns.
- Make sure Fury of Elune will be up at the end.

**Single target priority list INSIDE cooldowns:**
Before the 5s Sinful Hysteria buff:
- Use your trinket so that it will be for the rest of your cooldowns. (For example at 13s remaining for IQD or 17s in Bloodlust)
- Use pot at 17s Ravenous Frenzy remaining
- Cast Fury of Elune if Ravenous Frenzy has 4 or less seconds remaining
- Cast Starsurge to prevent capping Astral Power
- Keep up Moonfire, Sunfire and Stellar Flare
- Cast Wrath to fill

**During the 5s Sinful Hysteria buff:**
- Cast Starsurge to spend all your Astral Power
- Cast Wrath to fill

2+ target priority OUTSIDE cooldowns:

**Any situation:**
- Keep up Sunfire as long as your targets will live for another ~10 seconds (the amount of time is reduced per target hit).
- Keep up Starfall at all times or use on cooldown with Stellar Drift.
- Enter Solar Eclipse if that is your next Eclipse.
- Before Lunar Eclipse cast Moonfire if:
   - All targets can be hit by {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}}.
   - There are 5 or less targets (10 or less with Twin Moons).
   - All targets will live through the entire Lunar Eclipse.
   - You will not lose Starfall uptime.
- Enter Lunar Eclipse if you can.

**During Solar Eclipse:**
  - Use Starsurge to prevent overcapping.
  - Keep up Moonfire on up to 10 targets (20 with Twin Moons) if they will live through the next Eclipse and you won't lose Starfall uptime.
  - Starfire when 5 targets can be hit by it, increased by 1 target for every 20% mastery you have.
  - Cast {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}}.

**During Lunar Eclipse:**
  - Use {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} to prevent overcapping AsP until 6 targets at which point you should overcap.
  - Refresh Moonfire if you are at 4 (8 with Twin Moons) targets or below if the targets will live through the next Eclipse.
  - Cast Starfire

BEFORE cooldowns:

- If the pack will last more than 35s put Moonfire on up to 8 targets (16 with Twin Moons). This happens very rarely but is a gain in case it happens.
- Refresh Sunfire so you only have to refresh it once during Cooldowns.

DURING Ravenous Frenzy:
- Refresh Sunfire during pandemic
- Keep Starfall up at all times or on cooldown with Stellar Drift. Try to time the last Starfall with Drift so that it will be up during the last 8s of your cooldowns.
- Refresh Moonfire on up to 4 (8 with Twin Moons) targets
- https://wago.io/mYVIsyQN8 for filler. The recommendation this WeakAura gives is not correct when your targets will die before your cooldowns end or the targets are spread.
- If the filler is Wrath or up to 5 targets use Starsurge to prevent overcapping


<div id="minmax">

# [MinMax:](#minmax)

The following are super minor things you can do but are ultimately very insignificant:
- Dotting outside Eclipse without losing dot uptime on single target is a ~0.4% gain when not using Solstice.
- At 150%+ haste using Starfire is minorly better than Wrath on single target. This will only happen with Power Infusion or very high haste.
- With Stellar Drift it is dps neutral to Starfall during Ravenous Frenzy as long as you enter Sinful Hysteria with 90+ AsP.
- Without Incarnation and a low enough Precise Alignment it is a minor gain to use Ravenous Frenzy before Celestial Alignment so that CA will be up throughout Frenzy+Hysteria. The exact timing depends on your Precise Alignment rank but it should be no more than 2 globals after the Frenzy cast.
- If the fight time allows it wait for Euphoria/Fatal Flaw before using cooldowns. This is relevant for 5-6 min kill times.
- If the fight allows it wait for pot to be up again. This is relevant for 6min fights.
