## 9.1 TENTATIVE Changes

**{{< spell 274281 "Moons" >}} recharge time reduced from 25 seconds to 20 seconds and 33% dmg buff to NEW and HALF moon:**

Weak buff that does make it good enough for single target and Moons still suck in AoE. This does NOT buff full moon.

**{{< spell 343647 "Solstice" >}} increased Shooting Stars chance reduced from 300% to 250%:**

Major nerf that makes this talent only usable on spread AoE.

The {{< spell 274281 "Moons" >}} buffs and {{< spell 343647 "Solstice" >}} nerfs will mean that each talent in the row will be used in a different scenario: 
{{< spell 343647 "Solstice" >}} = Spread AoE; Fury of Elune = Stacked AoE; {{< spell 274281 "Moons" >}} = Single Target
