## Notes For the Boss:
- Look out for how long the adds live and by how many people they will be targeted, if some add will get passively cleaved (which will often be the case) make sure that you full dot it. 
- Look out for Solar Beamable adds far from the group, as you can single handedly keep an add in check for around 10 seconds. 
- Make sure to keep your Inc for the last phase if you would not lose a cast.
- Use barkskin whenever the pillars are about to explode.
- Try to position yourself around the middle of the room so you have control over the entire room

## Mythic only notes:
TBD

## Soulbinds:
WIP

## Talents:
- I would recommend picking Stellar Drift over Twin Moons because of how long the adds live. (at least on Heroic)
- Pick Guardian Aff over Resto because of the bursy ice pillar damage patterns. If vortex is required on the fixate adds, you can also spec into that and help out, but you will most likely have frost mages in the group and those will be dealt with that way.
