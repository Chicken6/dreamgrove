## Notes For the Boss:
- You can use Wild Charge and Soulshape/Door of Shadows for dance and for chain breaks.
- Use Barkskin on chain breaks.
- Full dot the adds if they do not die too quickly.

## Mythic only notes:
TBD

## Soulbinds:

<br>[Night Fae](https://ptr.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/night-fae/niya/druid)

## Talents:

This Fight is another ST spec with some Stellar Drift sprinkled in, being really good for the add phases and dance.
FoE can also be taken as Night Fae for the adds. You can hold your fist CDs for a bit to line it up with the adds. (Convoke after they are full dotted)
