Notes:

In raid with Nature's Balance first 12 Astral Power gets reset to 50

Start casting from max range at ~3.5 sec


## 2. What Legendaries should I craft?

**It is recommended that if you are competitive with raiding/m+/pvp you should not craft a legendary before mythic week.**

**Night Fae:**

In Raid: BoAT

In M+: BoAT or Pulsar if you are pulling really big

**Kyrian/Venthyr:**

In Raid: BoAT or Pulsar

In M+: Pulsar >= BoAT


## 3.What slot do I craft legendaries in?

**BoAT slot:**

In almost every scenario craft on boots (mastery and haste/vers).

The reason for this is that you can't get good stats on boots from neither raid nor m+.

**Pulsar slot:**

Gloves because of the fact that Denathrius shoulders have higher ilvl


## 4. What Covenant should i pick?

**Kyrian:**

Scales into AoE

**Night Fae:**

Very good on ST

**Venthyr:**

Good for high M+ with big pulls

**Necrolord:**

Not currently competitive


## 5. What Talents should I run?

TBD


## 6. What potions should I use?

Potion of Spectral Intellect for all cases, because it has very good AoE scaling and is very close to Phantom Fire which sims 10dps more on ST.


## 7. How does Kindred Spirits (Kyrian bond) work?

When you use it both people get an empty pool that lasts 20 seconds and 15% of your damage, healing and damage taken empties the pool to increase/lessen each. Each person also gets a buff that lasts 10 seconds and during that time 20% of your damage fills up the pool of the other person.


## 8. Who do I bond Kindred spirits with?

All specs with a 1min cd on abilities are good, for example MM hunter.


## 9. Should I delay Convoke for it to line up with CA?

If you do not lose a Convoke cast yes, if not press it on cd.


## 10. Should I pick another Covenant?

If you are not happy with your Covenant you can do that but you should not do it before mythic week in case of any nerfs.


## 11. How does Inscrutable Quantum Device work?

When this trinket is used, it triggers one of the effects listed above.

- remove CC from self: Always triggers if you are under a hard CC mechanic, does not trigger if the CC mechanic does not prevent the player from acting (e.g., it won't trigger while rooted).

- heal spell: Triggers on self or a nearby target with less than 30% health remaining.

- execute damage: Deal damage to the target if it is an enemy with less than 20% health remaining 

- triggers on a nearby healer with less than 20% mana.

- If a Bloodlust buff is up, the stat buff will last 25 seconds instead of the default 20 seconds.

- The secondary stat granted appears to be randomly selected from stat from the player's two highest secondary stats in terms of rating.



## 12. Is Balance/BoAT/Night Fae getting nerfed?

We do not know, we are not working at Blizzard.


## 13. What is Balance Druids stat priority?

Sim yourself on raidbots.com, stat weights differ a lot.

Note: 

In general BOAT devalues Crit.


## 14. What is my AoE priority?

**AoE (with Soul of the Forest+Stellar Drift):**

- Starfall perma up 

- sunfire perma up pref if you can hit all in 1 hit

**Lunar Eclipse:**

- do not Moonfire, just spam Starfire

**Solar:**

- keep Moonfire up to 10 targets if they live for more than 10-15sec

- Starfire on 5+ targets increased by 1 every 500 mastery

- Wrath if Starfire isn't worth casting

**Notes:**

- Prioritize Lunar Eclipse over Solar Eclipse

- Do not press Starsurge in Lunar Eclipse if over 6 targets can be hit by Starfire (yes overcap AsP)


## 15. How do I play with BoAT?

- Always pool so that you enter a new Eclipse with enough Astral Power to chain 3 Starsurges

- If this means you overcap that is fine and expected

- If you are able to use Starsurge outside the BoAT window and still have enough for the next one cast the Starsurge as early as possible

- With Convoke use up all Astral Power at the end of the previous Eclipse so that you enter the next Eclipse with less than 40 Astral Power and can cast Convoke
