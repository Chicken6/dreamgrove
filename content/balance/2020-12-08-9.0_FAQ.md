# Balance Druid FAQ

## 9.0.5 Changes

**Necrolord:  {{< spell 325727 "Adaptive Swarm" >}} damage and healing increased by 25% and the effectiveness of periodic effects increased to 35% (was 30%):**

While Adaptive Swarm definitely needed a buff this will barely change anything and is not anywhere close to enough to make it a viable spell. The problem with the spell lies in it being sustained damage that needs setup which is inherently worse than burst like all other covenant abilities and on top of that doesn't scale with targets. The changes allow Necrolord druids to do whopping 2.5% more single target damage and 1% more AoE damage.

**Venthyr:  {{< spell 341383 "Endless Thirst" >}}(Covenant Conduit) now increases your critical strike chance by .8% per stack at Rank 1 (was .5%):**

Venthyr also required some buffs but these don't address the main problem Venthyr Druids have which is horrendous single target damage. They were 9%(!) behind on single target compared to Night Fae and are now still 7% behind. That being said starting from 3 targets Venthyr is now the best Covenant. The extreme loss in single target damage will still only be very rarely worth it and at least for raids Venthyr will continue being a troll pick.

## 1. Openers

Start casting from max range at ~3.5 sec.


## 2. What Legendaries should I craft?

**Night Fae:**

In Raid: {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}}

In M+: {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} or {{< spell 338668 "Pulsar" >}} if you are pulling big commonly but currently not recommended due to the st loss.

**Kyrian/Venthyr:**

In Raid: {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}}

In M+: {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} for slightly more st and {{< spell 338668 "Pulsar" >}} for more AoE.


## 3.What slot do I craft legendaries in?

**{{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} slot:**

In almost every scenario craft on boots (mastery and haste/vers).

The reason for this is that you can't get good stats on boots without being lucky in the weekly chest. Difference is extremely small either way.

**{{< spell 338668 "Pulsar" >}} slot:**

Gloves because of the fact that Denathrius shoulders have higher ilvl.


## 4. What Covenant should I pick?

**Night Fae:**

By far the best Covenant for single target, easy to use and has extreme burst making it the best overall pick.

**Kyrian:**

Can perform well with a partner and is better in AoE than Night Fae but due to how the ability works it's rare to be able to get good value.

**Venthyr:**

Good for high M+ with big pulls but heavily outclassed on single target (roughly 7% worse than NF).

**Necrolord:**

Not currently competitive.


## 5. What Talents should I run?

Default single target setup (pure single target raid bosses):
{{< talents spec="balance" src="live" recommend="322,113,223,333,131,113,311" >}}

Default AoE setup (M+ and heavy AoE bosses):
{{< talents spec="balance" src="live" recommend="321,113,223,333,311,311,311" >}}
Note that {{< spell 248280 "Force of Nature" >}} can and should be used in M+ for any key level where the tank could die even though they are a minor dps loss.

Mixed target count or mostly spread AoE (Inerva, Council):
{{< talents spec="balance" src="live" recommend="311,113,223,333,232,311,311" >}}


## 6. What potions should I use?

{{< spell 307162 "Potion of Spectral Intellect" >}} for all cases.

## 7. How does {{< spell 326434 "Kindred Spirits" >}} (Kyrian covenant ability) work?

When you use it both people get an empty pool that lasts 20 seconds and 15% of your damage, healing and damage taken empties the pool to increase/absorb each. Each person also gets a buff that lasts 10 seconds and during that time 20% of your damage fills up the pool of the other person.


## 8. Who do I bond {{< spell 326434 "Kindred Spirits" >}} with and when do I use it?

All specs with a 1min cd on abilities are good, for example Mages and MM hunter. Always make sure you use it when your partner uses his cd and when using {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} make sure a {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} window is within bond buff.


## 9. Should I delay {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} for it to line up with CA?

Yes you should always delay Convoke UNLESS you can cast a {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} without losing a CA+{{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} (both at the same time) cast. This will for example happen in 5 minute fights where you would cast {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}}+CA on pull, {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} alone after 2 minutes and then {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}}+CA at 4 minutes.

## 10. Should I pick another Covenant?

If you are not happy with your current Covenant you can do that. The renown catchup is very forgiving, although if you are switching to Night Fae it should be noted that you only get the conduit {{< spell 341446 "Conflux of Elements" >}} on 145 ilvl.


## 11. How does Inscrutable Quantum Device work?

When this trinket is used, it triggers one of the effects listed below.

- Remove CC from self: Always triggers if you are under a hard CC mechanic, does not trigger if the CC mechanic does not prevent the player from acting (e.g., it won't trigger while rooted).

- Heal spell: Triggers on self or a nearby target with less than 30% health remaining.

- Execute damage: Deals damage to the target if it is an enemy with less than 20% health remaining. (You can prevent this by untargetting the mob.)

- Triggers on a nearby healer with less than 20% mana.

- If a Bloodlust buff is up, the stat buff will last 25 seconds instead of the default 20 seconds.

- The secondary stat granted is randomly selected from stat from the player's two highest secondary stats in terms of rating. In Bloodlust however, the highest stat will always be chosen.


## 12. Is Balance/BoAT/Night Fae/Necrolord getting nerfed?

We do not know, we are not working at Blizzard.


## 13. What is Balance Druids stat priority?

Sim yourself on using [Raidbots Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear). Do not follow any stat priorities.

## 14. What is my AoE priority?

**AoE (with {{< spell 114107 "Soul of the Forest" >}}+{{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" >}}) starting at 2 targets:**

**Any situation:**

- Keep Starfall permanently up at any cost.

- Keep Sunfire permanently up. (Be sure to hit all of the mobs with one Sunfire cast)

**Outside any Eclipse:**

- Refresh Moonfire before Lunar Eclipse when up to 5 targets can be hit by Starfire, they will live through the Lunar Eclipse and it means you don't lose Starfall uptime.

- Enter the next Eclipse if in no Eclipse, preferring Lunar Eclipse.

**Lunar Eclipse and both Eclipses(CA/Inc):**

- Use Starsurge to stop yourself from overcapping AsP until 6 targets at which point you should overcap.

- Refresh Moonfire if you are at 4 targets or below.

- Spam Starfire.

**Solar Eclipse:**

- Use Starsurge to stop yourself from overcapping AsP.

- Keep Moonfire up between 1 and 10 targets if they live through the next Eclipse and you won't lose Starfall uptime by doing so.

- Starfire when 5 targets can be hit by it, increased by 1 target for every 20% mastery you have.

- Wrath.

**Notes:**

- This should be used as a priority, going from top to bottom.


## 15. How do I play with {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}}?

- Always pool so that you enter a new Eclipse with enough Astral Power to chain 3 Starsurges.

- If this means you overcap that is fine and expected.

- If you are able to use Starsurge outside the {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} window and still have enough for the next one cast the Starsurge as early as possible.

- With Convoke use up all of your Astral Power at the end of the previous Eclipse so that you enter the next Eclipse with less than 40 Astral Power and can cast Convoke.


## 16. What is Astral damage?

Astral damage is Arcane and Nature damage at the same time meaning that these spells benefit from effects that buff either spell school and double dip whenever effects that buff both are active. Mind that class buffs only affect class spells so if a trinket does nature or arcane damage they are not affected by our buffs to these spell classes.


## 17. How to play NF double on use: 

**Basic version:** 
- Use Empyreal Ordnance on pull and 20sec before pressing {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}.
- Hold {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} for {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}.

**Advanced version:** 

- Use the normal NF {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} opener.
- Press Empyreal Ordnance in between the first 2 Starsurges (on pull), then spam Starfire in Lunar Eclipse while pooling for the next Solar Eclipse. 
- After exiting Lunar Eclipse (around 15sec into the fight) you want to go into Solar Eclipse, dump all your remaining AP and re use all 3 of your dots.
- Around 21sec into the fight, when you have the Empyreal Ordnance buff and can use your other trinket, press {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}, your 2nd on use trinket, your potion and {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}}.
- Continue your normal rotation.

**Notes:**

After the first CA Convoke you should be at 2 Starlord stacks. Because Convoke does not give you Starlord stacks, you want to use 1 Starsurge, then pool AsP up until your Starlord ends, then dump 3 Starsurges asap for the 3 Starlord stacks that should last until the end of your CA, then cancel Starlord at the start of your next Solar Eclipse if it does not line up.


## 18. How do I use instant Starfire procs from {{< spell 157228 "Owlkin Frenzy" >}}?

When Lunar Eclipse is active use it asap. When ONLY Solar Eclipse is active use it when fighting 3+ targets or when you need to move. Otherwise let it expire.


## 19. Useful CA + Convoke + Trinket macro:

#showtooltip

/stopmacro [noform:4]

/cast Celestial Alignment

/cleartarget

/use 13

/targetlasttarget

/use Potion of Spectral Intellect

/cast Convoke the Spirits

/cqs

**Explanation:**

- "/stopmacro [noform:4]" This line makes the macro not work if you are NOT in Moonkin Form.
- "/cast Celestial Alignment" This line casts {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}
- "/cleartarget" This line clears your current target. This is useful whenever using the "Inscrutable Quantum Device" trinket and makes it so that the trinket does not use its execute part.
- "/use 13" This line uses the trinket in the 13/upper slot. You can use 14 if your on use trinket is in the bottom slot.
- "/targetlasttarget This line retargets your last target after being cleared by the "cleartarget". 
- "/use Potion of Spectral Intellect" This line uses your potion. If your potion is not assigned to any specific point you can put it here.
- "/cast Convoke the Spirits" This line uses the Nightfae covenant ability.
- "/cqs" This line Cancels your Queued Spells. What this means is that your Convoke the Spirits will not get canceled if you press another button.

You can and should remove/add other commands to this macro depending on situation. For example the potion line, or the "stopmacro [noform:4]" line.

## 20. Do our dots snapshot?

No, our dots (Moonfire, Sunfire, Stellar Flare) do NOT snapshot, everything is dynamic. That means any dots gain/lose the mastery bonus upon entering/leaving the Eclipse that buffs them.

## 21. What is my filler priority inside {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}?

1 Target:
- Starfire if at or above 110% haste (You would currently need both Bloodlust and Power Infusion.)
- Wrath if below 110% haste

2 Targets and above:
- Starfire
