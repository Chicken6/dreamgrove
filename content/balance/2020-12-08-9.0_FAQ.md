# Balance Druid FAQ

### WE HAVE BEEN NERFED OH NO ARE WE TRASH NOW ARE WE DELETING BOAT
No BoAT is still our best legendary and you will still use it nearly exclusively in raid. Pulsar has gaind some value in M+ but will still be used for the same reasons. Starfall will still be used in the exact same way and the target thresholds have not changed.

The nerf is a ~2.6% nerf for single target and ~3.3% nerf in AoE when using BoAT or 1.6% nerf in AoE when using Pulsar. Slightly bigger nerf for meme encounters like Sun King.

## 1. Openers
Kyrian - with and without Balance of All Things(BoAT) with Nature's Balance(NB):<br/> Wrath, Wrath, Starfire, dots, Starfire, Starfire, Celestial Alignment/Incarnation(CA/Inc), Empower Bond, Starsurge 3x

Kyrian - with and without BoAT with Warrior of Elune(WoE):<br/> Wrath, Wrath, Starfire, dots, WoE, Starfire to 90 Astral Power(AsP) (~5x), CA/Inc, Empower Bond, Starsurge 3x


Night Fae - no BoAT (with NB):<br/> Wrath, Wrath, Starfire, dots, CA/Inc, Starsurge 2x, Convoke the Spirits(Convoke), Starsurge until you have no more AsP

Night Fae - with BoAT (with NB):<br/> Wrath, Wrath, Starsurge, Starsurge, dots, CA/Inc, Convoke, Starsurge until you have no more AsP

Night Fae - no BoAT (with WoE):<br/>Wrath, Wrath, Starfire, dots, CA/Inc, Convoke, Starsurge until you have no more AsP

Night Fae - with BoAT (with WoE):<br/>Wrath, Wrath, Starfire, dots, CA/Inc, Convoke, Starsurge until you have no more AsP, WoE, Starfire, Starsurge, Starfire, Starfire, Wrath 

Notes:

In raid with Nature's Balance first 12 Astral Power gets reset to 50

Start casting from max range at ~3.5 sec


## 2. What Legendaries should I craft?

**It is recommended that if you are competitive with raiding/m+/pvp you should not craft a legendary before mythic week.**

**Night Fae:**

In Raid: BoAT

In M+: BoAT or Pulsar if you are pulling big commonly

**Kyrian/Venthyr:**

In Raid: BoAT

In M+: BoAT has minorly more value and also Pulsar if you are pulling big commonly


## 3.What slot do I craft legendaries in?

**BoAT slot:**

In almost every scenario craft on boots (mastery and haste/vers).

The reason for this is that you can't get good stats on boots from neither raid nor m+.

**Pulsar slot:**

Gloves because of the fact that Denathrius shoulders have higher ilvl


## 4. What Covenant should I pick?

**Kyrian:**

Scales into AoE

**Night Fae:**

Very good on ST

**Venthyr:**

Good for high M+ with big pulls

**Necrolord:**

Not currently competitive


## 5. What Talents should I run?

TBD


## 6. What potions should I use?

Potion of Spectral Intellect for all cases, because it has very good AoE scaling and is very close to Phantom Fire which sims 10dps more on ST.


## 7. How does Kindred Spirits (Kyrian bond) work?

When you use it both people get an empty pool that lasts 20 seconds and 15% of your damage, healing and damage taken empties the pool to increase/lessen each. Each person also gets a buff that lasts 10 seconds and during that time 20% of your damage fills up the pool of the other person.


## 8. Who do I bond Kindred spirits with and when do I use it?

All specs with a 1min cd on abilities are good, for example MM hunter. Always make sure you use it when your partner uses his cd and when using BoAT make sure a BoAT window is within bond buff.


## 9. Should I delay Convoke for it to line up with CA?

If you do not lose a Convoke cast yes, if not press it on cooldown. Similarly you delay CA for Convoke if you would not lose a CA cast. The exception for this is when using a strong on use trinket like Quantum Device or Empyreal Ordnance in which case you should always delay Convoke for CA unless the fight would be over before you could combo them again.


## 10. Should I pick another Covenant?

If you are not happy with your Covenant you can do that but you should not do it before mythic week in case of any nerfs.


## 11. How does Inscrutable Quantum Device work?

When this trinket is used, it triggers one of the effects listed above.

- remove CC from self: Always triggers if you are under a hard CC mechanic, does not trigger if the CC mechanic does not prevent the player from acting (e.g., it won't trigger while rooted).

- heal spell: Triggers on self or a nearby target with less than 30% health remaining.

- execute damage: Deal damage to the target if it is an enemy with less than 20% health remaining 

- triggers on a nearby healer with less than 20% mana.

- If a Bloodlust buff is up, the stat buff will last 25 seconds instead of the default 20 seconds.

- The secondary stat granted appears to be randomly selected from stat from the player's two highest secondary stats in terms of rating.


## 12. Is Balance/BoAT/Night Fae getting nerfed?

We do not know, we are not working at Blizzard.


## 13. What is Balance Druids stat priority?

Sim yourself on raidbots.com, stat weights differ a lot.

Note: 

In general BOAT devalues Crit.


## 14. What is my AoE priority?

**AoE (with Soul of the Forest+Stellar Drift):**

- Keep Starfall permanently up.

- Keep Sunfire permanently up. (Be sure to hit all of the mobs with one Sunfire cast)

**Lunar Eclipse:**

- Do not Moonfire, just spam Starfire if you are at 5 targets or above.

- Moonfire if you are at 4 targets or below.

- Spam Starfire.

**Solar:**

- Keep Moonfire up between 5 and 10 targets if they live for more than 10-15sec.

- Starfire on 5 targets or above, increased by 1 every 20% mastery. (Only if you can hit all of them)

- Wrath if Starfire isn't worth casting.

**Notes:**

- This should be used as a priority, going from top to bottom.

- Prioritize Lunar Eclipse over Solar Eclipse.

- Do not press Starsurge in Lunar Eclipse if you are on 6 targets or above and they can be hit by Starfire. (Yes, overcap AP)


## 15. How do I play with BoAT?

- Always pool so that you enter a new Eclipse with enough Astral Power to chain 3 Starsurges

- If this means you overcap that is fine and expected

- If you are able to use Starsurge outside the BoAT window and still have enough for the next one cast the Starsurge as early as possible

- With Convoke use up all Astral Power at the end of the previous Eclipse so that you enter the next Eclipse with less than 40 Astral Power and can cast Convoke


## 16. What is Astral damage?

Astral damage is Arcane and Nature damage at the same time meaning that these spells benefit from effects that buff either spell school and double dip whenever effects that buff both are active. Mind that class buffs only affect class spells so if a trinket does nature or arcane damage they are not affected by our buffs to these classes.


## 17. How to play NF double on use: 

**Basic version: 
- Use Empyreal Ordnance on pull and 20sec before pressing CA.
- Hold Convoke for CA.

**Advanced version: 

- Use the normal NF BOAT opener.
- Press Empyreal Ordnance in between the first 2 Starsurges (on pull), then spam Starfire in lunar Eclipse while dumping Starsurges as fast as possible. 
- After exiting Lunar Eclipse (around 15sec into the fight) you want to go into Solar Eclipse, dump all your remaining AP and re use all 3 of your dots.
- Around 21sec into the fight press CA, your 2nd on use trinket, your potion and Convoke.
- Continue your normal rotation.

**Notes: 
After the first CA Convoke you should be at 2 Starlord stacks. Because Convoke does not give you Starlord stacks, you want to use 1 Starsurge, then pool AP up until your Starlord ends, then dump 3 Starsurges asap for the 3 Starlord stacks that should last until the end of your CA, then cancel Starlord at the start of your next solar eclipse if it does not line up.
