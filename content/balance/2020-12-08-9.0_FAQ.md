# Balance Druid FAQ

## 1. Openers
Kyrian - with and without {{< spell 339942 "Balance of All Things(BoAT)" >}} with {{< spell 202430 "Nature's Balance(NB)" >}}:<br/> Wrath, Wrath, Starfire, dots, Starfire, Starfire, Celestial Alignment/Incarnation(CA/Inc), {{< spell 326462 "Empower Bond" >}}, Starsurge 3x

Night Fae - no BoAT (with NB):<br/> Wrath, Wrath, Starfire, dots, CA/Inc, Starsurge 2x, {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}}, Starsurge until you have no more AsP

Night Fae - with BoAT (with NB):<br/> Wrath, Wrath, Starsurge, Starsurge, dots, CA/Inc, Convoke, Starsurge until you have no more AsP

 
Notes:

In raid with Nature's Balance first 12 Astral Power gets reset to 50.

Start casting from max range at ~3.5 sec.


## 2. What Legendaries should I craft?

**Night Fae:**

In Raid: {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}}

In M+: {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} or {{< spell 338668 "Pulsar" >}} if you are pulling big commonly

**Kyrian/Venthyr:**

In Raid: {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}}

In M+: {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} has minorly more value and also {{< spell 338668 "Pulsar" >}} if you are pulling big commonly


## 3.What slot do I craft legendaries in?

**{{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} slot:**

In almost every scenario craft on boots (mastery and haste/vers).

The reason for this is that you can't get good stats on boots from neither raid nor m+.

**{{< spell 338668 "Pulsar" >}} slot:**

Gloves because of the fact that Denathrius shoulders have higher ilvl.


## 4. What Covenant should I pick?

**Kyrian:**

Scales into AoE

**Night Fae:**

Very good on ST

**Venthyr:**

Good for high M+ with big pulls

**Necrolord:**

Not currently competitive


## 5. What Talents should I run?

Default single target setup (pure single target raid bosses):
{{< talents spec="balance" src="live" recommend="322,113,223,333,131,113,311" >}}

Default AoE setup (M+ and heavy AoE bosses):
{{< talents spec="balance" src="live" recommend="321,113,223,333,311,311,311" >}}
Note that {{< spell 248280 "Force of Nature" >}} can and should be used in M+ for any key level where the tank could die even though they are a minor dps loss.

Mixed target count or mostly spread AoE (Inerva, Council):
{{< talents spec="balance" src="live" recommend="311,113,223,333,232,311,311" >}}


## 6. What potions should I use?

{{< spell 307162 "Potion of Spectral Intellect" >}} for all cases.

## 7. How does {{< spell 326434 "Kindred Spirits" >}} (Kyrian covenant ability) work?

When you use it both people get an empty pool that lasts 20 seconds and 15% of your damage, healing and damage taken empties the pool to increase/lessen each. Each person also gets a buff that lasts 10 seconds and during that time 20% of your damage fills up the pool of the other person.


## 8. Who do I bond {{< spell 326434 "Kindred Spirits" >}} with and when do I use it?

All specs with a 1min cd on abilities are good, for example MM hunter. Always make sure you use it when your partner uses his cd and when using {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} make sure a {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} window is within bond buff.


## 9. Should I delay {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} for it to line up with CA?

Yes you should always delay Convoke UNLESS you can cast a {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} without losing a CA+{{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} (both at the same time) cast. This will for example happen in 5 minute fights where you would cast {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}}+CA on pull, {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} alone after 2 minutes and then {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}}+CA at 4 minutes.

## 10. Should I pick another Covenant?

If you are not happy with your current Covenant you can do that. The renown catchup is very forgiving, although if you are switching to Night Fae it should be noted that you only get the conduit {{< spell 341446 "Conflux of Elements" >}} on 145 ilvl.


## 11. How does Inscrutable Quantum Device work?

When this trinket is used, it triggers one of the effects listed below.

- remove CC from self: Always triggers if you are under a hard CC mechanic, does not trigger if the CC mechanic does not prevent the player from acting (e.g., it won't trigger while rooted).

- heal spell: Triggers on self or a nearby target with less than 30% health remaining.

- execute damage: Deals damage to the target if it is an enemy with less than 20% health remaining. (You can prevent this by untargetting the mob.)

- Triggers on a nearby healer with less than 20% mana.

- If a Bloodlust buff is up, the stat buff will last 25 seconds instead of the default 20 seconds.

- The secondary stat granted is randomly selected from stat from the player's two highest secondary stats in terms of rating. In Bloodlust however, the highest stat will always be chosen.


## 12. Is Balance/BoAT/Night Fae getting nerfed?

We do not know, we are not working at Blizzard.


## 13. What is Balance Druids stat priority?

Sim yourself on [Raidbots](https://www.raidbots.com), stat weights differ a lot.

Note: 

In general {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} devalues Crit.


## 14. What is my AoE priority?

**AoE (with {{< spell 114107 "Soul of the Forest" >}}+{{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" >}}):**

- Keep Starfall permanently up at any cost.

- Keep Sunfire permanently up. (Be sure to hit all of the mobs with one Sunfire cast)

- Refresh Moonfire before Lunar Eclipse when up to 5 targets can be hit by Starfire, they will live through the Lunar Eclipse and it means you don't lose Starfall uptime.

- Enter the next Eclipse if in no Eclipse, preferring Lunar Eclipse.

**Lunar Eclipse:**

- Refresh Moonfire if you are at 4 targets or below.

- Spam Starfire.

**Solar:**

- Keep Moonfire up between 1 and 10 targets if they live through the next Eclipse and you won't lose Starfall uptime by doing so.

- Starfire when 5 targets can be hit by it, increased by 1 target for every 20% mastery you have.

- Wrath.

**Notes:**

- This should be used as a priority, going from top to bottom.

- Do not press Starsurge in Lunar Eclipse if you are on 6 targets or above and they can be hit by Starfire. (Yes, overcap AP)


## 15. How do I play with {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}}?

- Always pool so that you enter a new Eclipse with enough Astral Power to chain 3 Starsurges.

- If this means you overcap that is fine and expected.

- If you are able to use Starsurge outside the {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} window and still have enough for the next one cast the Starsurge as early as possible.

- With Convoke use up all of your Astral Power at the end of the previous Eclipse so that you enter the next Eclipse with less than 40 Astral Power and can cast Convoke.


## 16. What is Astral damage?

Astral damage is Arcane and Nature damage at the same time meaning that these spells benefit from effects that buff either spell school and double dip whenever effects that buff both are active. Mind that class buffs only affect class spells so if a trinket does nature or arcane damage they are not affected by our buffs to these classes.


## 17. How to play NF double on use: 

**Basic version:** 
- Use Empyreal Ordnance on pull and 20sec before pressing {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}.
- Hold {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} for {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}.

**Advanced version:** 

- Use the normal NF {{< spell 339942 "BoAT" >}} opener.
- Press Empyreal Ordnance in between the first 2 Starsurges (on pull), then spam Starfire in Lunar Eclipse while pooling for the next Solar Eclipse. 
- After exiting Lunar Eclipse (around 15sec into the fight) you want to go into Solar Eclipse, dump all your remaining AP and re use all 3 of your dots.
- Around 21sec into the fight press {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}, your 2nd on use trinket, your potion and {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}}.
- Continue your normal rotation.

**Notes:**

After the first CA Convoke you should be at 2 Starlord stacks. Because Convoke does not give you Starlord stacks, you want to use 1 Starsurge, then pool AP up until your Starlord ends, then dump 3 Starsurges asap for the 3 Starlord stacks that should last until the end of your CA, then cancel Starlord at the start of your next solar eclipse if it does not line up.


## 18. How do I use instant Starfire procs from {{< spell 157228 "Owlkin Frenzy" >}}?

When Lunar Eclipse is active use it asap. When ONLY Solar Eclipse is active use it when fighting 3+ targets or when you need to move. Otherwise let it expire.
