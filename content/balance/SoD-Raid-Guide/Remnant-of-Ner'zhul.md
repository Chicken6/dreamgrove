## Notes For the Boss:
- You can use Wild Charge and Soulshape if badly positioned in order to stop the knockback from the dispells.
- Door of Shadows is usable whenever you need to get into positioning fast for dispells.
- I did not see any usage for Barkskin or Healthstones so use them as needed.

## Mythic only notes:
TBD

## Soulbinds:

[Night Fae](https://ptr.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/night-fae/niya/druid)

## Talents:

You can run a full ST setup changing between FoE and Moons depending on covenant. I personally did not see the point in Stellar Drift as you could always Wild Charge one of the knockbacks and if Night Fae Soulshape the other, so positioning (at least on HC) was irrelevant.
